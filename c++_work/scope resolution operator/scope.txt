scope resolution operator:

The :: (scope resolution) operator is used to qualify hidden names so that
 you can still use them. You can use the unary scope operator if a namespace
 scope or global scope name is hidden by an explicit declaration of the same
 name in a block or class.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class X
{
public:
   static int count;
};
int X::count = 10;               
int main ()
{
   int X = 0;                     
   cout << X::count << endl;     
}
